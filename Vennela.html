                    Project:1
                    <h3>Title : Block chain based certificate validation.</h3>
                    Description:
                   ▪ This project leverages the strengths of blockchain technology to create a robust, secure, and efficient certificate
                   validation system, providing significant benefits to educational institutions, employers, and certificate holders.
                   ▪ We have developed a secure and Immutable System, Created Standardized Digital Certificates, Integrated
                   Decentralized and off-chain Storage Solutions, Enhanced Security and Privacy, Conducted Comprehensive
                   Testing.
                   ▪ The blockchain-based certificate validation project successfully created a secure, decentralized system for
                   issuing, storing, and verifying certificates. By leveraging block-chain technology, we enhanced the authenticity
                   and integrity of certificates, streamlined the verification process, and provided a reliable solution that benefits
                   educational institutions, employers and certificate holders alike.
                   
                   <br>Project:2
                    <h3>Title : Data mining approaches for diagnosing chronic kidney conditions.</h3>
                    Description:
                   ▪ A comprehensive report documenting the data mining process and findings.
                   ▪ A functional decision support system prototype.
                   ▪ A validated machine learning model for CKD diagnosis and progression prediction.
                   ▪ Documentation and user guides for system deployment and use.
                   ▪ These data mining approaches provide a powerful toolkit for understanding and managing chronic kidney
                   conditions, helping to improve patient outcomes through more precise and timely interventions.
